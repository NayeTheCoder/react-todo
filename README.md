# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Todo
I am a big fan of using sticky notes to write down my top priorities for the day. 
This was heavily inspired by my habit of just jotting things down that I need to complete each day. Normally on a sticky note I will jot down the day of the week and date and then list my tasks. This is a virtual app that takes away the need to use paper :D
